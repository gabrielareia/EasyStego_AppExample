# EasyStego_AppExample

## A simple application to show what EasyStego can do.
 
I created a very basic application, nothing fancy at all, but is enough to test the [EasyStego](https://github.com/gabrielareia/EasyStego) library.
 
EasyStego is a library to create steganography in images, using C#. You can hide images or texts inside your images. It's very fun. Check it out.
